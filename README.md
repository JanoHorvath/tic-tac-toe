# tic-tac-toe
super-simple python tic-tac-toe game engine

WORK IN PROGRESS

Define your AI in the __init__ method of theGame.py file.

Then either let two AIs compete against each other by running run.py file, or play as a human player against one of them (player2 is always ai).

After every game a log is created. To load a log, run load_existing.py. Use the 'LOG this state' button to log an intermediate state of the game.


Enjoy :)
